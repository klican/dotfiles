#After quit ranger writes in "bookmarks" automatically the last accessed
#directory. This is causing git to permanently show an unstaged change
#because of this one line so ~/.config/bookmarks file is now ignored by
#git.
#This backup file is not used by ranger, but is tracked by git for my
#manual changes. If I manually add a new bookmark here, I have just to make
#a new copy of this file and substitute it for ranger's  "bookmarks" file.
